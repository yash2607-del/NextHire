## 📦 Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm
- MongoDB Atlas or local MongoDB instance

Optional:

- SMTP provider (email)
- Object storage (resume uploads)

## 🔐 Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file inside the `server/` directory (do not commit this file).

Required:

```
MONGO_URL=your_mongodb_connection_string
PORT=5000
JWT_SECRET=your_secure_jwt_secret
```

### Frontend (Vite) env

The frontend reads the backend base URL from `VITE_API_URL`.

- If you set `VITE_API_URL` to the server origin (e.g. `https://nexthire-hfj1.onrender.com`), the client will automatically target the API under `/api`.
- If you set `VITE_API_URL` including `/api` (e.g. `https://nexthire-hfj1.onrender.com/api`), that also works.

Defaults in this repo:

- Production: `client/.env.production`
- Development: `client/.env.development`

Vercel recommendation:

- Set `VITE_API_URL` in Vercel Project Settings → Environment Variables for both **Production** and **Preview** to `https://nexthire-hfj1.onrender.com/api`.

Optional:

```
SMTP_HOST=
SMTP_PORT=
SMTP_USER=
SMTP_PASS=

S3_BUCKET=
S3_KEY=
S3_SECRET=
S3_REGION=
```

## ⚡ Quick Start (Windows PowerShell)

### Backend

```powershell
cd c:\Users\dishi\nexthire\NextHire\server
npm install
copy .env.example .env
npm run dev
```

### Frontend

```powershell
cd c:\Users\dishi\nexthire\NextHire\client
npm install
npm run dev
```

Run frontend and backend in separate terminals.

## 🔁 Running Concurrently

Use two terminals, or use process managers such as `concurrently` or `pm2`.

## 🔒 Security Notes

- Never commit `.env` files
- Rotate credentials immediately if exposed
- Enforce role-based access for recruiter actions
- Validate and sanitize all inputs
- Use environment variables for all secrets
